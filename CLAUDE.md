## Project Overview

**Name:** PIM — Personal Information Manager  
**Goal:** A web-based application for managing contacts, notes, tasks, and calendar events in one unified interface.  
**Audience:** Solo users who want a private, fast, self-hosted alternative to fragmented productivity tools.  
**Status:** Phase 5 — Search Module (next)

## Coding Conventions

### General
- Use **ES modules** (`import`/`export`) everywhere — no CommonJS `require()`
- Use **async/await** — never raw `.then()` chains
- All functions must have a **JSDoc comment** describing purpose, params, return value
- Max file length: **300 lines** — split into modules if exceeded
- No `console.log` in committed code — use the logger utility

### Naming
- Files: `kebab-case.js` / `kebab-case.jsx`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Functions & variables: `camelCase`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Database tables: `snake_case` (plural: `contacts`, `notes`, `tasks`)
- Database columns: `snake_case`

### API Design
- REST endpoints follow: `GET /api/contacts`, `POST /api/contacts`, `PATCH /api/contacts/:id`, `DELETE /api/contacts/:id`
- All responses: `{ data, error, meta }` envelope
- Errors always include a `code` string (e.g. `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`)
- HTTP status codes must be semantically correct

### React
- Functional components only — no class components
- Custom hooks live in `client/src/hooks/` and are prefixed `use`
- No inline styles — use Tailwind classes exclusively
- Forms use controlled components with local state

### Database
- All schema changes go through a migration file in `db/migrations/`
- Never mutate `schema.sql` directly after initial creation
- Use parameterised queries — **never string-interpolate user input into SQL**

---

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

Every feature follows this pipeline. **No implementation starts without an approved spec.**

```
[IDEA] → requirements.md → design.md → tasks.md → [IMPLEMENT] → [REVIEW]
          (Requirements    (Design      (Task        (Implementer  (Reviewer
           Agent)          Agent)       Agent)        Agent)        Agent)
```

### Phase Gate Rules
1. **Requirements → Design:** You (the human) must explicitly say "requirements approved" before the Design Agent runs
2. **Design → Tasks:** You must say "design approved" before the Task Agent runs
3. **Tasks → Implementation:** You must say "tasks approved" before the Implementer Agent runs
4. **Implementation → Merge:** The Reviewer Agent runs automatically; you approve the review

### Spec File Locations
```
.claudedoc/{feature-name}/
├── requirements.md    ← WHAT it does (user stories, acceptance criteria)
├── design.md          ← HOW it works (architecture, data model, API contract)
└── tasks.md           ← ordered, atomic implementation steps
```

## Agent Roster

| Agent          | File                        | Responsibility                                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Requirements   | `.claude/agents/requirements.md` | Interviews user, writes `requirements.md`      |
| Design         | `.claude/agents/design.md`       | Writes `design.md` from requirements           |
| Task           | `.claude/agents/tasks.md`        | Writes `tasks.md` from design                  |
| Implementer    | `.claude/agents/implementer.md`  | Writes code per task, one commit per task      |
| Reviewer       | `.claude/agents/reviewer.md`     | Validates code against spec, reports gaps      |

## Session Startup Checklist

**Every agent, every session, before touching any file or writing any code:**

```
Step 1 — Check current branch:
  $ git branch --show-current

Step 2 — If the output is `main` or `master`: STOP.
  Create or switch to the correct feature branch:
  $ git checkout -b feature/{feature-name}
  OR switch to the existing branch:
  $ git checkout feature/{feature-name}

Step 3 — Confirm you are on the feature branch, then proceed.
  Report to the user: "✅ On branch feature/{feature-name}. Proceeding."
```

**This check is not optional. It runs before the first file read, the first
code change, and the first commit — every single session without exception.**

---

## Git Conventions

### Branch Rules (HARD RULES — never negotiated)

- **Never commit to `main` or `master` directly. Ever.**
- Every piece of work happens on a named branch.
- Branch naming: `feature/{feature-name}`, `fix/{issue}`, `chore/{topic}`
- If you are unsure which branch to use, ask the user before proceeding.
- If `git status` shows you are on `main`, stop and switch before writing anything.

### Per-Task Commit Discipline

- One commit per completed task from `tasks.md` — not one commit per session
- Commit message format (Conventional Commits): `feat(contacts): add create contact API endpoint`
- Each commit must pass `npm test` before being made
- Never batch multiple tasks into one commit

### Pull Request Flow

- **Never merge directly to `main`** — open a PR even when working solo
- PR title mirrors the feature branch name
- PR description references the spec: `.claudedoc/{feature}/requirements.md`

### If You Forget (Recovery)

If a commit was accidentally made to `main`:
```bash
# Move the commit to a new branch, reset main
git checkout -b feature/{feature-name}
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1   # undo the commit on main
```

---

## Testing Requirements

- Every API endpoint must have at least one integration test
- Every React component with user interaction must have a unit test
- E2E tests cover the happy path of each major user flow
- Run tests: `npm test` (unit) | `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright)

## Current Phase Status

| Phase | Module      | Status      | Spec Location              |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 1     | Contacts    | ✅ Complete    | `.claudedoc/contacts/`  |
| 2     | Notes       | ✅ Complete    | `.claudedoc/notes/`     |
| 3     | Tasks       | ✅ Complete    | `.claudedoc/tasks/`     |
| 4     | Calendar    | ✅ Complete    | `.claudedoc/calendar/`  |
| 5     | Search      | ⬜ Not Started | —                        |

## Do's and Don'ts for All Agents

### DO
- Run the **Session Startup Checklist** (above) before anything else
- Confirm your branch with `git branch --show-current` and report it to the user
- Read this file at the start of every session
- Update the Phase Status table when a phase completes
- Ask clarifying questions before writing specs or code
- Make one atomic change at a time; commit before moving on
- Reference spec files using `@.claudedoc/contacts/requirements.md` syntax

### DON'T
- Touch any file before confirming you are on a feature branch
- Commit to `main` or `master` under any circumstances
- Start implementing before a spec is approved
- Add dependencies not listed in the Tech Stack section
- Skip writing tests
- Write SQL with string interpolation
- Modify another agent's output without noting it in a comment
